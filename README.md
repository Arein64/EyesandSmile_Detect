# EyesandSmile_Detect
This is a simple project made with Python and OpenCV. It uses pre-trained Haar Cascade models to detect a person's face, eyes, and smile in real-time using a webcam.

To run the project download the Haar Cascades files(frontal_face_default.xml,eye.xml and smile.xml)

When you are done running the file, enter q to exit the webcam window.
